Original data sets come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals. Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm. 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing FrequencyDomain variables. 

This large data set was used to:

1. extract just values for mean and standard deviation of all variables
2. change variable names into more understandable 
3. calculate average values for each subject for each activity.

There were all together 30 subjects (from test and training sets).
Six (6) different activities were measured: walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs,sitting, standing and laying

New table called tidy.data consists of 81 variable. Each variable is in columns. It starts with subject, activity and that is followed by variables listed below.

'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.
